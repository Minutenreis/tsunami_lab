Tsunami-Simulation User Documentation
=====================================

Installing and Running
----------------------


* clone the project with :code:`git clone https://github.com/Minutenreis/tsunami_lab.git` 
* add the submodules with :code:`git submodule init` and :code:`git submodule update`
* build with :code:`scons`
* execute the Dam Break Problem with :code:`./build/tsunami_lab [-s solver] [-u setup] [-b "boundary_left boundary_right"] number_of_cells` 
* execute the tests with :code:`./build/tests`

The output of the Dam Break Problem is in :code:`/solutions`
